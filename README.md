# beamCV

This project is based on the [Object Detection](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels/vision/object_detection) tutorial made by TensorFlow authors.

A common homework problem for an engineering structures class is the [beam analysis](https://mechanicalc.com/reference/beam-analysis) where given a diagram of a beam, applied forces and moments, the student is asked to calculate and plot the internal forces and moments in the beam. This project aims to train a model to recognize the components of a beam diagram in order to be able to perform the beam analysis.
